Project Summary
Technology Stack:

    Server-side: Node.js with Express framework
    Database: MongoDB
    Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
    Middleware: Custom-built middleware for stateless authentication
    Environment Management: dotenv
    Dependencies: bcrypt, body-parser, config, dotenv, express, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, morgan, multer
    Dev Dependencies: nodemon

Purpose:

This project offers a blueprint for creating a robust, secure, and scalable User Authentication RESTful API. It operates on a stack fortified by Node.js with Express, glued to a MongoDB database. The main spotlight here is on the two endpoints, /user/signup and /user/login, engineered meticulously to manage user authentication. JWT takes the center stage in ensuring secure data exchange between server and client.
Features:

    Endpoints:
        Signup: Checks if the user already exists, hashes the password if new, and stores it in the MongoDB database.
        Login: Validates user credentials, and if successful, returns a JWT for future authenticated actions.

    Middleware:
        Validates incoming JWTs, facilitating a stateless authentication mechanism.
        Attached to routes that need secure access.

    Environment Variables:
        dotenv manages sensitive data such as API keys and DB credentials, keeping them away from source code for an extra layer of security.

    CORS Management:
        Accepts requests from any origin, configurable via headers.

    Logging & Monitoring:
        Server logging on startup, also involves usage of the morgan package for HTTP request logging.

    File Uploads:
        multer is in the dependency list, suggesting capabilities for handling multipart/form-data, commonly used for uploading files.

    Development:
        Nodemon for hot-reloading during development.

Security:

Emphasizes secure storage of sensitive information using dotenv, which supports encryption/decryption and operates via environment variables, a more secure methodology compared to global variables or command-line arguments.
Additional Information:


This project is a comprehensive template for those wanting to integrate secure, efficient, and stateless user authentication in their Node.js applications. It blends mainstream technologies with best practices to yield a product that's not just functionally rich but also secure and maintainable.

üîä Attention all Developers and Users:

The code provided in this repository is presented "as-is" without any guarantees, warranties, or promises of its efficacy or security. It's important to recognize that this User Authentication RESTful API was originally designed as a part of a larger, more comprehensive project. While it serves as a strong foundational piece and a good starting point, it may not cover all the intricate details or requirements you may have for your specific application.

Here's what you need to know:

    Scope: This code serves as an example or a template, and is not intended to be a fully-fledged, production-ready solution. Tailoring to fit your particular use-case is strongly recommended.

    Security: While best practices have been followed, no code is entirely foolproof. Make sure to conduct your own security audits, particularly if you plan to use this in a production environment.

    Dependencies: Always check the latest versions of dependencies and ensure compatibility. Some might be deprecated or might have introduced breaking changes.

    Testing: The code has not undergone rigorous testing for all edge cases. Employ extensive testing strategies before deploying to production.

    Consult Resources: Make sure to consult additional resources and documentation to understand the full context and capabilities of the individual components used in this project.
